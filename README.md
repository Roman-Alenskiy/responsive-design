# responsive-design
In this project, Iâ€™ll build a responsive website, through cloning [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

Feel free to use your browser web tools to see responive design in full glory.

Also adapted for mobile devices.
